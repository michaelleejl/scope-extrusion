\chapter{Background}
The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate, and propose, policies for mediating the interaction between Macocaml-style compile-time \textbf{metaprogramming} and \textbf{effect handlers}, by addressing the issue of \textbf{scope extrusion}.

In this chapter, I lay the groundwork for the evaluation. I provide technical overviews of each of the three key concepts: metaprogramming (\Cref{section:metaprogramming-technical}), effect handlers (\Cref{section:effects-technical}), and scope extrusion (\Cref{section:scope-extrusion-technical}).

\section{Metaprogramming}\label{section:metaprogramming-technical}
How does one write fast and maintainable code? A na√Øve answer is ``by being a skilled programmer''\footnote{Though not the worst answer -- }.
