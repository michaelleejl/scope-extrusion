\chapter{Background}
The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate existing, and propose new, policies for mediating the interaction between MacoCaml-style \textbf{metaprogramming} and \textbf{effect handlers}, by addressing the issue of \textbf{scope extrusion}.

This chapter provides technical overviews of each of the key concepts: metaprogramming (\Cref{section:metaprogramming-technical}), effect handlers (\Cref{section:effects-technical}), and scope extrusion (\Cref{section:scope-extrusion-technical}).
