\chapter*{Abstract}
There are many different ways to manage the interaction between compile-time metaprogramming and effect handlers, but to my knowledge, there has been no way to evaluate them against each other. This dissertation introduces such a mechanism, focusing on correctness, expressiveness, and efficiency. Additionally, I evaluate existing approaches by the aforementioned mechanism, illustrating the trade-offs in the design space. Finally, I introduces a novel approach, a dynamic Best-Effort check, that I show is correct, and strikes a reasonable trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency as compared to existing checks.
