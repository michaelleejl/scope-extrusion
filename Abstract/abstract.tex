\chapter*{Abstract}
There are many different ways to manage the interaction between compile-time metaprogramming and effect handlers, but there has been no way to evaluate them against each other. This dissertation introduces such a mechanism, focusing on correctness, expressiveness, and efficiency. Second, we evaluate existing approaches by the aforementioned mechanism, illustrating the trade-offs in the design space. Finally, we introduces a novel approach, a dynamic Best-Effort check, that we show is correct, fairly expressive, and likely more efficient in the common case, as compared to existing checks.
