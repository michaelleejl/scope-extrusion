\chapter*{Abstract}
Metaprogramming and effect handlers interact in unexpected, and sometimes undesirable, ways. One example is scope extrusion: the generation of ill-scoped code. There are many different ways to manage this interaction, but to my knowledge, until now there has been no way to evaluate them against each other. This dissertation introduces such a mechanism, which I use to evaluate the correctness, expressiveness, and efficiency of existing scope extrusion checks. Additionally, I introduce a novel approach, a dynamic Best-Effort check, that I show is correct, and occupies a goldilocks zone between expressiveness and efficiency, as compared to existing checks.
